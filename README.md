<h1>Non-Invasive Health Monitoring System for Hydration and Diabetes Risk Detection<br></h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2> An interdisciplinary project that combines biosensor hardware, synthetic data generation,
machine learning, and biomedical signal analysis to build a non-invasive health monitoring system
capable of assessing skin hydration and early diabetes risk.
<br>
<h2>Objective</h2>To design and simulate a real-time health monitoring system that uses skin-based sensors
and user parameters to: - Estimate hydration levels - Assess probabilistic diabetes risk.
<br>
<h2>Motivation</h2>Diabetes is a growing global health concern and often goes undiagnosed in early stages. -
Skin hydration and thickness can serve as indirect indicators of metabolic conditions. - Wearable or
portable health tech offers promising opportunities for early screening.
